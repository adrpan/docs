# The Casper Event Sidecar

The Casper Event Sidecar is an application running alongside the node process, allowing subscribers to monitor the event stream without querying the node. The application usually runs on the same machine as the node process, but it can be configured to run remotely if necessary. The load on the node process is thus drastically reduced. Users needing access to the JSON-RPC will still need to query the node directly.

An alternate name for this application is the SSE Sidecar because it uses the node's Event Stream API returning Server-Sent Events (SSEs) in JSON format. Visit GitHub for detailed information on the following:

If you see any errors, you may need to [update the configuration](#configuring-the-service) and restart the service with the commands below.

**Stopping the service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop casper-event-sidecar.service
```

**Starting the service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start casper-event-sidecar.service
```

## Configuring the Sidecar Service {#configuring-the-sidecar}

Detailed node configuration instructions are available in GitHub.
<!-- TODO link GitHub to ETC_README.md#configuration from the sidecar repo -->

If the service was installed on a Casper node, this file holds a default configuration: `/etc/casper-event-sidecar/config.toml`. The file is also available in GitHub.
<!-- TODO link GitHub to resources/default_config.toml from the sidecar repo -->

Operators have the option to configure an administrative REST server that exposes a `metrics` endpoint.
<!-- TODO link GitHub [admin_server] documentation -->

Operators need to update the Sidecar configuration file according to their needs. GitHub has further details regarding each configuration option.

## Monitoring the Sidecar's Event Stream

It is possible to monitor the Sidecar's event stream using *cURL*, depending on how the HOST and PORT are configured.

```bash
curl -s http://HOST:PORT/events/CHANNEL
```

- `HOST` - The IP address where the Sidecar is running
- `PORT` - The port number where the Sidecar emits events
- `CHANNEL` - The type of emitted event

Given the default configuration, here are the commands for each endpoint:
<!-- TODO link "default configuration" to the default_config.toml#L27-L29 -->

- **Deploy events:** 

    ```bash
    curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/deploys
    ```

- **Finality Signature events:** 

    ```bash
    curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/sigs
    ```

- **Main events:** 

    ```bash
    curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/main
    ```

- **Sidecar-generated events:** 

    ```bash
    curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/sidecar
    ```

### The API Version of Node Events

An `ApiVersion` event is always emitted when a new client connects to a node's SSE server, informing the client of the node's software version.

When a client connects to the Sidecar, the Sidecar displays the node’s `ApiVersion`, which it receives from the node. Then, it starts streaming the events coming from the node. The `ApiVersion` may differ from the node’s build version.

If the node goes offline, the `ApiVersion` may differ when it restarts (i.e., in the case of an upgrade). In this case, the Sidecar will report the new `ApiVersion` to its client. If the node’s `ApiVersion` has not changed, the Sidecar will not report the version again and will continue to stream messages that use the previous version.

Here is an example of what the API version would look like while listening on the Sidecar’s `DeployAccepted` event stream:

```bash
curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/deploys

data:{"ApiVersion”:”1.4.8”}

data:{"DeployAccepted":{"hash":"00eea4fb9baa37af401cba8ffb96a1b96d594234908cb5f9de50effcb5b1c5aa","header":{"account":"0202ed20f3a93b5386bc41b6945722b2bd4250c48f5fa0632adf546e2f3ff6f4ddee","timestamp":"2023-02-28T12:21:14.604Z","ttl":"30m","gas_price":1,"body_hash":"f06261b964600caf712a3ea0dc54448c3fcc008638368580eb4de6832dce8698","dependencies":[],"chain_name":"casper"},"payment":{"ModuleBytes":{"module_bytes":"","args":[["amount",{"cl_type":"U512","bytes":"0400e1f505","parsed":"100000000"}]]}},"session":{"Transfer":{"args":[["amount",{"cl_type":"U512","bytes":"05205d59d832","parsed":"218378100000"}],["target",{"cl_type":{"ByteArray":32},"bytes":"6fbe4634d42aa1ae7820eed35bcbd5c687de5c464e5348650b49a21a17c8dcb5","parsed":"6fbe4634d42aa1ae7820eed35bcbd5c687de5c464e5348650b49a21a17c8dcb5"}],["id",{"cl_type":{"Option":"U64"},"bytes":"00","parsed":null}]]}},"approvals":[{"signer":"0202ed20f3a93b5386bc41b6945722b2bd4250c48f5fa0632adf546e2f3ff6f4ddee","signature":"02b519ecb34f954aeb7afede122c6f999b2124022f6b653304b2891c5428b074795ad9232a409aa0d3e601471331ea50143ca4c378306ffcd0f8ff7a60e13f19db"}]}}

#### Middleware Mode

The Sidecar can connect simultaneously to nodes with different build versions, which send messages with different API versions. There is also the rare possibility of nodes changing API versions and not being in sync with other connected nodes. Although this situation would be rare, clients should be able to parse messages with different API versions.

### The Version of Sidecar Events

When a client connects to the `events/sidecar` endpoint, it will receive a message containing the version of the Sidecar software. Release version `1.1.0` would look like this:

```bash
curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/sidecar

data:{"SidecarVersion":"1.1.0"}

:

:

```

Note that the `SidecarVersion` differs from the `APIVersion` emitted by the node event streams. You will also see the keep-alive messages as colons, ensuring the connection is active.

### The Node Shutdown Event

When the node sends a [Shutdown event](./node-events.md#shutdown-events) and disconnects from the Sidecar, the Sidecar will report it as part of the event stream and on the `/events/deploys` endpoint. The Sidecar will continue to operate and attempt to reconnect to the node according to the `max_attempts` and `delay_between_retries_in_seconds` settings specified in its configuration.

The Sidecar does not expose `Shutdown` events via its REST API. 

Here is an example of how the stream might look like if the node went offline for an upgrade and came back online after a `Shutdown` event with a new `ApiVersion`:

```bash
curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/deploys

data:{"ApiVersion":"1.5.2"}

data:{"BlockAdded":{"block_hash":"b487aae22b406e303d96fc44b092f993df6f3b43ceee7b7f5b1f361f676492d6","block":{"hash":"b487aae22b406e303d96fc44b092f993df6f3b43ceee7b7f5b1f361f676492d6","header":{"parent_hash":"4a28718301a83a43563ec42a184294725b8dd188aad7a9fceb8a2fa1400c680e","state_root_hash":"63274671f2a860e39bb029d289e688526e4828b70c79c678649748e5e376cb07","body_hash":"6da90c09f3fc4559d27b9fff59ab2453be5752260b07aec65e0e3a61734f656a","random_bit":true,"accumulated_seed":"c8b4f30a3e3e082f4f206f972e423ffb23d152ca34241ff94ba76189716b61da","era_end":{"era_report":{"equivocators":[],"rewards":{"01026ca707c348ed8012ac6a1f28db031fadd6eb67203501a353b867a08c8b9a80":1559401400039,"010427c1d1227c9d2aafe8c06c6e6b276da8dcd8fd170ca848b8e3e8e1038a6dc8":25895190891},"inactive_validators":[]},"next_era_validator_weights":{"01026ca707c348ed8012ac6a1f28db031fadd6eb67203501a353b867a08c8b9a80":"50538244651768072","010427c1d1227c9d2aafe8c06c6e6b276da8dcd8fd170ca848b8e3e8e1038a6dc8":"839230678448335"}},"timestamp":"2021-04-08T05:14:14.912Z","era_id":90,"height":1679394427512,"protocol_version":"1.0.0"},"body":{"proposer":"012bac1d0ff9240ff0b7b06d555815640497861619ca12583ddef434885416e69b","deploy_hashes":[],"transfer_hashes":[]}}}}

Note that the Sidecar can emit another type of shutdown event on the `events/sidecar` endpoint, as described below.

### The Sidecar Shutdown Event

If the Sidecar attempts to connect to a node that does not come back online within the maximum number of reconnection attempts, the Sidecar will start a controlled shutdown process. It will emit a *Sidecar-specific Shutdown* event on the [events/sidecar](#the-sidecar-shutdown-event) endpoint, designated for events originating solely from the Sidecar service. The other event streams do not get this message because they only emit messages from the node.

The message structure of the Sidecar shutdown event is the same as the [node shutdown event](#the-node-shutdown-event). The sidecar event stream would look like this:

```bash
curl -sN http://127.0.0.1:19999/events/sidecar

data:{"SidecarVersion":"1.1.0"}

:

:

:

data:"Shutdown"
id:8
```

## Swagger Documentation

Once the Sidecar is running, operators and developers can access the Swagger documentation to test the Sidecar's REST API.

```bash
http://HOST:PORT/swagger-ui/
```

Replace the `HOST` with the IP address of the machine running the Sidecar application remotely; otherwise, use `localhost`. The `PORT` is usually `18888`, but it depends on how the Sidecar was configured. 

For example, if you are an operator running the Sidecar service on your node, you would access the Swagger documentation like this:

```bash
http://localhost:18888/swagger-ui/
```

## The Admin Server

If enabled, the Sidecar administrative API can be accessed with the following command:

```bash
http://HOST:PORT/metrics/
```

Replace the `HOST` with the IP address of the machine running the Sidecar application remotely; otherwise, use `localhost`. The `PORT` is usually `18887`, but it depends on how the Sidecar was configured. 

For example, if you are an operator running the Sidecar service on your node, you would access the admin server like this:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18887/metrics/
```
